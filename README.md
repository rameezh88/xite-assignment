## Notes About Improvements

### Corners cut:

- I've skipped the filtering of the videos based on year because I was exceeding the time limit for the assignment.

### Improvements:

- Unit tests.
- Animations.
- Performance.
- Better design.

### Known issues:

- Because of there being many items in the list, The FlatList scrolling is pretty jittery. I would have liked to work on optimising this.
